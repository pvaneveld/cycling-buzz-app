### :mag: What?

A timeline with cycling news headlines from my personal favorite cyclists.

### :question: Why

This is a learning project to fiddle around with some technologies i hadn't used before:
- vue apollo
- tailwind

### :wrench: How

The main parts of the stack are as follows:

- `Vue`: framework of choice.
- `tailwind`: css util library.
- `apollo`: platform for building an graphQL API.
